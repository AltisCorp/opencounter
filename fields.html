  <h1>Working From Home</h1>
  
  <p>You can work from home as long as you're not negatively impacting the neighborhood by increasing visitors or traffic, creating a lot of noise, or working with hazardous materials. You also can't have a sign on your home advertising the business.</p>
  
  <p>More precisely: work-from-home businesses &mdash; known as "home occupations" &mdash; need to follow the rules outlined in section <a href="http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruz/html/SantaCruz24/SantaCruz2410.html#24.10.160">24.10.160</a> of the city of Santa Cruz's Municipal Code.</p>
  
  <h3 class="toggle">Santa Cruz Municipal Code 24.10.160</h3>
  <blockquote class="drawer">
    <ol>
      <li>Intent. The discretionary approval of a home occupation is intended to allow for home enterprises, which are clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling unit and compatible with surrounding residential uses. A home occupation allows for the gainful employment in the home by any occupant of a dwelling so long as the enterprise does not require frequent customer access or have associated characteristics which would reduce the surrounding residents’ enjoyment of their neighborhood.</li>
      <li>General. A home occupation shall be operated and maintained only by a resident of the dwelling unit in which it occurs; shall not employ any help other than the members of the resident family or household; shall not change the residential character of the dwelling units; shall not generate a vehicular traffic increase of more than six trip ends (three round trips) per day including deliveries and clients.</li>
      <li>Restrictions. A home occupation shall not involve:
        <ol>
          <li>The use of an area greater than four hundred feet;</li>
          <li>The use of any required front or exterior side yard area or setback area, nor the use of any required covered or uncovered on-site parking space;</li>
          <li>Any activity or use which involves:
            <ol>
              <li>A significant increase in vehicular trips to the residence;</li>
              <li>Storage or use of hazardous or unsanitary materials;</li>
              <li>Creation of noise levels exceeding the standards of this title and/or other nuisance factors inconsistent with Chapter 24.14, Part 2: Performance Standards;</li>
              <li>Auto/truck/motorcycle/motor boat repair.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The placement of a sign advertising the business.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Permits Required. A zoning clearance and business license shall be required, except for small family day care which is exempt from local regulations.</li>

  <p>By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.
  <p>The first hurdle to starting a business is finding a location that permits your use.</p>

<div class="screen" id="usePermits">

  <h1>Use Permits</h1>
  
  <p>The type of use permit you need is dependent on the way your zoning district permits your use.</p>
  
  <p class="s">If what you do is Principally Permitted all you need is a [linklabel label="Zoning Clearance"]. This is the simplest form of a use permit.</p>
  [accordion label="Zoning Clearance"]
  <p class="s">Zoning Clearance: the simplest form of use permit. It is typically issued same day with minimal review.</p>
  [/accordion]
  <p class="s">If your use is not principally permitted you will need either an [linklabel label="Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit"].</p>
  [accordion label="Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit"]
  <p class="s">Admin Use Permit(AUP): This kind of application requires more staff analysis, and more information from the applicant. These permits entail a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator, and can take approximately 6-8 weeks to work their way through to completion.</p>
  <p class="s">Special Use Permit(SUP): Requires a high level of scrutiny, typically due to the size of the project and its impact on the neighborhood. These applications go to Planning Commission, whose decision is ratified by the City Council. SUPs take 2-3 months.</p>
  [/accordion]
  <p class="s">If your use is not permitted, you should [linklabel label="probably"]pick another spot.</p>
  [accordion label="probably"]
  <p class="s">Changing the Zoning is very difficult, rare and takes years. It is not recommended, but you are welcome to contact the planning department for more information.</p>
  [/accordion]

<div class="screen" id="useIntensity">

  <h1>Intensity of Use</h1>
  
  <p>In California, we our responsibility to mitigate the impact of changes of use if the “intensity” of use increases. This means accounting for more traffic, parking and people using the space.</p>

  <p>A gym has a more "intense use" than a warehouse. This means more parking is needed and means more cars on the road.</p>
  
  <p>If the prior use of your site is similar or more intense than what you do, this doesn't affect you. Move along!</p>
  [accordion label="similar or more intense"]
  <p>Here are some businesses listed from light to intense use: Warehouse &lt; Shoe store &lt; Restaurant</p>
  <p>More information coming soon.</p>
  [/accordion]
  <p class="s">But, if you need to change a space to a more "intense use" you must pay for the impacts you'll be causing. Please [linklabel label="read more about it"].</p>
  [accordion label="read more about it"]
  <p class="mini">This is a complicated concept.</p>
  <p class="s">It costs a lot to keep the traffic of Santa Cruz flowing.</p>
  <p class="mini">If your business has a higher traffic need than your space allows it is your responsibility to pay into a fund that helps traffic improvements. This is done by a one time charge called Traffic Impact Fee (TIF). TIF helps pay for things like wider lanes and signalized intersections.</p>
  <p class="s">TIF can be $1000 to $200,000. This is why we reccomend picking a location with a similar use to yours.</p>
  <p class="mini">The fee is based on the number of trips your use switch causes. Here is a tool that helps estimate the fee: <iframe src="http://pdfmongotest.herokuapp.com/tif-calculator.html" frameborder="0" width="450" height="550"></iframe></p>
  [/accordion]
  <p class="s">If you love a space with a serious TIF you should talk to the <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=446" target="_blank">Office of Economic Development</a>. They will try to help.</p>

<div class="screen" id="parking">

  <h1>Parking</h1>

<p class="s">A business must provide sufficient parking.</p>
<p class="b">If you don't have enough spaces, your customers will use the street, which will block traffic, or use other businesses' spots, which is not fair.</p>
<p class="s">Your use affects the parking [linklabel label="spaces required"]. More people buy food than couches, so a super market requires more parking than a furniture store.</p>
[accordion label="spaces required"]
<p class="s">Here is the table that is used to calculate the number of parking spots needed for space and use.</p>
[table id=2 / ]
<p class="s">If the resulting number of parking spots contains a fraction and that fraction is greater than half you must round up and add a full parking space.</p>

# Ask: Business License

Business License (Business Tax Registration):
Any person or entity carrying on a trade or business must obtain a business
license, use and occupancy permit or business tax certificate including those
that are located outside the city limits but perform services for customers
inside the city limits.

In Santa Cruz, business licenses cost $145.15 a year, plus $4 for each additional employee.

Business Licenses help the city categorize employers and keep track of its employment base. This is important information that guides city services. Your business License needs to be renewed each year.

The $145.15 fee goes toward the general fund that pays for city staff.
