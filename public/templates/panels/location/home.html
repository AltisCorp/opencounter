    <p class="lead">You can work from home as long as you're not negatively impacting the neighborhood by increasing visitors or traffic, creating a lot of noise, or working with hazardous materials. You also can't have a sign on your home advertising the business.</p>
    <p class="lead toggle">More precisely: work-from-home businesses &mdash; known as "home occupations" &mdash; need to follow the rules outlined in section <a href="http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruz/html/SantaCruz24/SantaCruz2410.html#24.10.160">24.10.160</a> of the city of Santa Cruz's Municipal Code, which you should read right now &darr;</p>
    <blockquote class="drawer">
      <ol>
        <li>Intent. The discretionary approval of a home occupation is intended to allow for home enterprises, which are clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling unit and compatible with surrounding residential uses. A home occupation allows for the gainful employment in the home by any occupant of a dwelling so long as the enterprise does not require frequent customer access or have associated characteristics which would reduce the surrounding residents? enjoyment of their neighborhood.</li>
        <li>General. A home occupation shall be operated and maintained only by a resident of the dwelling unit in which it occurs; shall not employ any help other than the members of the resident family or household; shall not change the residential character of the dwelling units; shall not generate a vehicular traffic increase of more than six trip ends (three round trips) per day including deliveries and clients.</li>
        <li>Restrictions. A home occupation shall not involve:
          <ol>
            <li>The use of an area greater than four hundred feet;</li>
            <li>The use of any required front or exterior side yard area or setback area, nor the use of any required covered or uncovered on-site parking space;</li>
            <li>Any activity or use which involves:
              <ol>
                <li>A significant increase in vehicular trips to the residence;</li>
                <li>Storage or use of hazardous or unsanitary materials;</li>
                <li>Creation of noise levels exceeding the standards of this title and/or other nuisance factors inconsistent with Chapter 24.14, Part 2: Performance Standards;</li>
                <li>Auto/truck/motorcycle/motor boat repair.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The location is in a residential or mixed use zoning district</li>
            <li>The placement of a sign advertising the business.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Permits Required. A zoning clearance and business license shall be required, except for small family day care which is exempt from local regulations.</li>
