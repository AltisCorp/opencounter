    <ol>
      <li class="lead">First, secure a <strong>planning permit</strong> from the City&rsquo;s Planning Department. If you&rsquo;re starting a business, even if you're working from home, the City has to approve that use in your location.</li>
      <li class="lead">Next, if you&rsquo;re doing any renovations or tenant improvements, get a <strong>building permit</strong> from the City of Santa Cruz Building Department.</li>
      <li class="lead">Finally, obtain a <strong>business license</strong> from the City of Santa Cruz Finance Department.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="lead">While that covers most City processes, there are also county, regional, state, and federal regulations that may apply to your business. We&rsquo;ve included tools to help you research and fulfill those requirements, too.</p>
