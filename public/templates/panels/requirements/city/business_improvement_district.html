The Assessments are collected by the City of Santa Cruz and forwarded directly to the <a href="http://www.downtownsantacruz.com/" target="_blank">Downtown Association of Santa Cruz</a>. You don't have to fill out a separate application form, as you'll be sent a bill once you register a Business License, this page is to help you estimate your semi-annual fees. This is the best estimation we can give now with the information you've provided.</p>

(Business Area X Rate [.34] X Type X Zone) + $50.00 = Annual Assessment
Annual Assessment / 2 = Semi-Annual Assessment

Calculation Example: 
(1,000 Sq Ft) x .34 x 100% (Type 1) x 60% (Zone 2) + $50.00 = $236.00 / 2 = $118.00 Semi-Annual Assessment

TYPE 1 - 100%	 RETAIL & FOOD
TYPE 2 - 60%	 FINANCIAL, BARS & THEATERS
TYPE 3 - 40%	 WHOLESALE TRADE, SERVICES & PROFESSIONS, AUTO DEALERS

ZONE 1 - 100%	 CAP OF 10,000 SQ FT
ZONE 2 - 60%	 CAP OF 10,000 SQ FT
