In order to calculate the fee, we need to know
whether this business is Class A, Class B, or Class C. Maps to the same logic as the business license (small miracle that)

Business Improvement Assessments are based on the following formula:

(Business Area X Rate [.34] X Type X Zone) + $50.00 = Annual Assessment
Annual Assessment / 2 = Semi-Annual Assessment

Calculation Example: 
(1,000 Sq Ft) x .34 x 100% (Type 1) x 60% (Zone 2) + $50.00 = $236.00 / 2 = $118.00 Semi-Annual Assessment


// Round to nearest cent
total = Math.round(100 * total) / 100;
