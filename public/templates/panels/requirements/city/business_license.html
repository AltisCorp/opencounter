  <p class="lead">Everyone who operates a business in the City needs to register with the City's Finance department for a business license. This is an annual requirement that the City uses to track who makes up our business community and what they are doing.</p>
  <p class="lead">The fees for this are $145.15 plus employees fees of $2.55, $4.95, or $7.40 for each employee depending on your type of business. It's important to remember that you'll be responsible for this fee even if you conduct business for a single day (the fee will be pro-rated). </p>
  <p class="lead">You are exempt from the fee if your business is a registered nonprofit organization.</p>
  <p class="lead">Fees for your business license are used to support general city services, including police and fire protection, as well as for the services supplied by the City's Finance, Planning and Community Development Staff and other City Administrative Functions.</p>
  <p class="lead">After you register with the City, we'll sent a once a year renewal letter to you.</p>

<!-- 

In order to calculate the fee, we need to know
whether this business is Class A, Class B, or Class C.

See: http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=764

Class A: $145.15 base tax plus $2.55 per employee
Class B: $145.15 base tax plus $4.95 per employee
Class C: $145.15 base tax plus $7.40 per employee

=======================================

var base_tax = 145.15,
    employees = [employee_count],
    class = [business_type_class],
    employee_rate,
    total;

switch(class) {
    case 'class-a':
        employee_rate = 2.55;
        break;
    case 'class-b':
        employee_rate = 4.95;
        break;
    case 'class-c':
        employee_rate = 7.40;
        break;
    default:
        // throw exception
        break;
}

// Formula from http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/index.aspx?page=764
total = base_tax + (employee_rate * employees);

// Round to nearest cent
total = Math.round(100 * total) / 100;
