          <h3>Zoning</h3>
          <p>Zoning basically makes sure a rubber factory can’t open next to a preschool.</p>
          <p>By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.</p>
          <p>The first hurdle to starting a business is finding a location that permits your use.</p>
          <p>[zoningmap]</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="use">
          <h3>Prior Use</h3>
          <p>A good tip for finding a location that permits your use is to pick a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.</p>
          <p>If you are opening a restaurant try to go into a space that held a restaurant.</p>
          <p>If you are opening a yoga studio try to go into, say, a karate studio.</p>
          <p>This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.</p>
          <p>If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="permits">
          <h3>Permits</h3>
          <p>The type of use permit you need is dependent on the way your zoning district permits your use.</p>
          <p>If what you do is Principally Permitted all you need is a Zoning Clearance. This is the simplest form of a use permit.</p>
          <p>If your use is not principally permitted you will need either an Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit ⇣.</p>
          <p>Admin Use Permit(AUP): This kind of application requires more staff analysis, and more information from the applicant. These permits entail a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator, and can take approximately 6-8 weeks to work their way through to completion.</p>
          <p>Special Use Permit(SUP): Requires a high level of scrutiny, typically due to the size of the project and its impact on the neighborhood. These applications go to Planning Commission, whose decision is ratified by the City Council. SUPs take 2-3 months.</p>
          <p>If your use is not permitted, you should probably ⇣ pick another spot. (Changing the Zoning is very difficult, rare and takes years. It is not recommended, but you are welcome to contact the planning department for more information.)</p>

          <h3>Intensity of Use &amp; Traffic Impact Fee</h3>
          <p>In California, if your business has a more intense use than the previous business in that space, it’s your responsibility to mitigate the impact of that change.</p>
          <p>You do this via a one-time payment of a Traffic Impact Fee, or TIF.</p>
          <p>TIF funds help the city of Santa Cruz pay for things like wider lanes and signalized intersections -- which helps the city of Santa Cruz accommodate the increased traffic and public parking burden that your business imposes.</p>
          <p>Depending on where you site your business, your TIF can be $1000 to $200,000. This is why we recommend picking a location with a similar use to yours.</p>
          <p>This tool will help you estimate the fee.</p>

          <p>If you are located downtown, you don’t need to provide parking, but you must pay for it.</p>
          <p>Downtown has shared parking with reduced requirements. So if you don’t have off street parking, you can pay into a shared fund that runs the City garages and lots.</p>
