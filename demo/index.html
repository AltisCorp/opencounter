          <h1>The Big Picture</h1>
          <p>Here's how to start a business in the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, secure a <strong>use permit</strong> from the City&rsquo;s Planning Department. If you&rsquo;re starting a business, even if you're working from home, the City has to approve that use in your location. <a href="#">Skip to use permit helper &rarr;</a></li>
            <li>Next, if you&rsquo;re doing any renovations or tenant improvements, get approval from the City of Santa Cruz Building Department. <a href="#">Skip to building permit helper &rarr;</a></li>
            <li>Finally, obtain a <strong>business license</strong> from the City of Santa Cruz Finance Department. <a href="#">Skip to business license &rarr;</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>While that covers most City processes, there are also county, regional, state, and federal regulations that may apply to your business. We&rsquo;ve included tools to help you research and fulfill those requirements, too.</p>

A home occupation shall be operated and maintained only by a resident of the dwelling unit in which it occurs; shall not employ any help other than the members of the resident family or household; shall not change the residential character of the dwelling units; shall not generate a vehicular traffic increase of more than six trip ends (three round trips) per day including deliveries and clients.</li>

          <h1>Siting Your Business</h1>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re not working out of your home, you will need to pick a location that is zoned to allow businesses like yours to operate.</p>
          <h3>Zoning</h3>
          <p>Zoning laws limit the types of businesses that can operate within a particular area.</p>
          <p>Why? By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.</p>
          <p>Think of it this way: zoning makes sure a rubber factory can&rsquo;t open next to a preschool.</p>
          <p>In Santa Cruz, all zones are defined by title 24 of the City&rsquo;s municipal code.</p>
          <h3>Use &amp; Prior Use</h3>
          <p>A good tip for finding a location that permits your use is to pick a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.</p>
          <p>This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.</p>
          <p>If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
          <p>For example, if you are opening a restaurant, try to go into a space that previously held a restaurant.</p>
