<h3>Zoning</h3>

Zoning basically makes sure a rubber factory canâ€™t open next to a preschool.

By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.

The first hurdle to starting a business is finding a location that permits your use.

A good tip for finding a location that permits your use is to pick a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.

If you are opening a restaurant try to go into a space that held a restaurant.

If you are opening a yoga studio try to go into, say, a karate studio.

This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.

If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.
