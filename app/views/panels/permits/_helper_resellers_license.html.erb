        Is your business a retail establishment?
        NOTE: The seller's permit can NO LONGER be filed by mail or e-mail. It can only be filed through their online system, which is a train wreck and requires special registration.
                <!-- I don't know what to do with this right now-->
                <!-- Begin Seller's Permit -->
                <!-- CONDITION: Business is a retail establishment -->
                <!-- End Seller's Permit -->
